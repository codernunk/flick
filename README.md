# Flick!
Flick is an open source 2D platformer game made with the Godot game engine (version 4.x). 
The game itself involves the titular character, Flick, being thrust out of his couch potato lifestyle to protect his home from the evil weed overlord, Oliv Garc. Flick is granted a power from a unsuspecting partner, named Handsie, the ability to launch in any direction via a flick from the player. How will Flick utilize this power to save his home and lifestyle?

## How Flick Came to Be
Originally, Flick! was a project a friend and I were planning to make years ago when we wanted to get into game development. However, both my friend and I took different career paths and I took ownership of the project. Nowadays, as I try to make games again, I wanted to make use of the idea we had for this game, but I didn't want to commit as much time to it as the other game I want to make. To compromise, I decided to make this game open source, hoping that I can keep the idea of the game alive, while making it easier for my contributions, while also providing the Godot community with a tool they can use for their games.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites (Godot, Git)
Flick! is currently being developed with Godot v4.1.3. Make sure to follow the download and installation guide for the Godot game engine on your system before running Flick!

## Game Design Documentation
To understand the rationale behind the game mechanics and how the game is generally designed, refer to this 
[Game Design Documentation](GAME_DESIGN.md) here.

## Codebase Documentation
Whether you plan to contribute, or are just using Flick! as an example project to get your own game up and running, we've provided some documentation on why and how the project is set up the way it is. In addition to that, there are also a set of best practices and naming conventions provided to help you follow along. These practices are by no means mandatory to follow, and there may be times where breaking them serves a higher purpose, so keep that in mind as you follow along with the game's source code.

## Promotional Materials
Before I decided to make the game open source, I made a website to promote the game for use as an application to a game convention: https://flick.nunkware.digital/
This website will remain open as a reference for those looking to build their own games. I'll eventually look into migrating the website over to GitHub hosting so it can remain here.
