## Overview and Gameplay Loop

Seeds and Spuds
Seeds are earned through completing levels in Campaign, Challenge Levels, Enemy Trials, or Multiplayer Battles. Seeds can also be purchased.
Seeds are required to attempt a level, even if the level was previously completed. When the player dies within the level, he will lose seeds.
Seeds are also used to purchase in-game content, such as customization options.
Seeds are organized into six colors: red, blue, yellow, green, black and white.
Spuds are potato creatures that have been captured by Rott N. Potato.
Spuds are earned for completing challenges for the various game modes, such as completing a level for the first time, clearing Time Trials, etc.
Spuds are required to access further levels in the Campaign, Challenge Levels, and for certain customization options that provide upgraded effects.
Spuds cannot be purchased.
