# Exhaustive licensing information for files in the flick repository
# =========================================================================
# This copyright notice is templated from the Godot source repository here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt
#
# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the flick repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by flick.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
#
# Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
# ------------------------------------
#
# Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'thirdparty/' directory
# are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
# in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
# code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.
# For example:
#   Files: ./thirdparty/zlib/
#   Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
#   License: Zlib
# The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
# files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
# (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as flick is concerned
# the library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
#
# Note: When linking dynamically against thirdparty libraries instead of
# building them into the Godot binary, you may remove the corresponding
# license details from this file.
