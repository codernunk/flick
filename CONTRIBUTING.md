# Contributing to Flick!
Thank you for your consideration of contributing to Flick! People like you will help us make a complete 2D sample game for use by Godot developers worldwide!

As of right now, the Flick! repository is NOT currently accepting contributors until the lead developer (codernunk) feels it is ready to do so. However, the vision of this project is to allow other contributors in the future. This documentation will be updated once contributors are allowed.
